## Set up

* In the project directory:
  * run `bin/setup` to set up the dependencies (including installing Bundler and Rails), the database, and populate seed data.
  * run `bin/rails s` to run the application server.

## The API

Following the instructions above, you should be able to access the API by visiting http://localhost:3000/ with any HTTP client, such as a web browser. Results are returned in JSON format, which should be mostly self-explanatory.
